# Forge Diagnose

**Activates:** on failure during execute, prove, or land.

## Phases

1. **Reproduce** — exact command, env flags, error output (copy verbatim)
2. **Isolate** — narrow to file/test; git bisect if regression unknown
3. **Hypothesize** — max 3 causes ranked; pick one to test first
4. **Fix & prove** — minimal change; re-run failing + related tests

## Techniques

- Read stack trace bottom-up to first project frame
- Compare with last green commit (`git diff`)
- Check env flags (`.env`, `vi.stubEnv` in tests)
- For flakes: run test 3× before declaring fixed

## Defense

- Add regression test in `forge-prove` before closing diagnose
- If root cause is missing guard, fix at boundary not call site only

## Exit

Document in handoff: root cause one sentence + test that prevents recurrence.
